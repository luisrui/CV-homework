## My Cv HOMEWORK
This is a plan for CV training and Machine Learning

### Clustering Algorithm
#### Linkage Alogorithm
linkage algorithm is a typical example of hierarchical clustering, I use three method: Alink, Slink and Clink here and use data in package for testing. It is not friendly for a large quantity of dots.

#### K-means
K-means algorithm is a typical example of partitional clustering, I use K-means++ as an optimization to initiate the number of clusters. It is friendly for large quantities of dots, but doesn't perform well.
